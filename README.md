# generic-banking
This is an exercise I wrote to get comfortable with file I/O in Java 17, along with creating an application that uses a state machine pattern. When it comes to storing the information of each bank account, I went with CSV and the opencsv library, since it's not that complicated of a format to read and parse.

## Running the program
Download the jar in the release section and run it through your terminal:
``$ java -jar ./generic-banking.jar``

## Building the program
This program was written using IntelliJ IDEA, and uses the IntelliJ compiler. You can clone this repo and build it very easily through IntelliJ IDEA.
